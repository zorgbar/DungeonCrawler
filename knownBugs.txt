There are a number of known bugs in the game.
1. "Ghost Enemies": Currently when generating dungeons, sprites that do not do anything appear around the dungeon.
2. Equipping an item while an item is equipped will delete the old item.
3. Ranged enemies struggle to attack the player in the latest release of the game.
